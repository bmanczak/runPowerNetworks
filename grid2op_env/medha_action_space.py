This module contains functions to create a list of all possible actions.

Each action corresponds to a specific configuration of a specific substation.
An action is given by a dictionary {"set_bus" : substation_config} where
substation_config is again a dictionary of the form

substation_config = {"loads_id" : [(id1,busbar_nr), (id2,busbar_nr), ...], 
                     "generators_id" : [(id1,busbar_nr), (id2,busbar_nr), ...],
                     "lines_or_id" : [(id1,busbar_nr), (id2,busbar_nr), ...],
                     "lines_ex_id" : [(id1,busbar_nr), (id2,busbar_nr), ...]}

which specifies how the included assets (given via their ids) are connected to
busbars. For example,

substation_config = {'loads_id': [], 
                     'generators_id': [(4, 1)],
                     'lines_or_id': [(0, 1), (1, 1)],
                     'lines_ex_id': []}
This substation_config is represented by the variable "act_dict"

Note that for the actions space the ids have to be chosen consistently,
that is, related to only one substation.

The list of actions is created by looping through all substations and creating
all valid substation configurations for each substation.
A crucial command to do this is:
env.get_obj_connect_to(None, substation_nr).items()

which gives the ids of all the elements connected to a specific substation as
well as the total number of elements connected. For example, for 
substation_nr=1 one obtains

dict_items([('loads_id', array([0])),
            ('generators_id', array([0])),
            ('lines_or_id', array([2, 3, 4])),
            ('lines_ex_id', array([0])), 
            ('nb_elements', 6)])

The actions are constructed in such a way that they satisfy the substation
related constraints. However, the connex constraint is not checked.

After substation_config is created (or "act_dict"), this needs to be translated 
into a format to be used within the grid2op package which defines how an action
is displayed. It is of a datatype called "TopologyAction" which
is derived from "Action_space" method and it needs a dictionary of the type:
    {"set_bus":substation_config} 
    where substation is the "key" of this dictionary
Another key that this "Action_space" method can take is "change_bus" but that 
is not considered here.
